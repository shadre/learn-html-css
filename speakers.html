            <h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>

            <p>
              Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process.
              Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic
              interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is
              even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves
              the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.

            <p>
              By setting constraints, we force ourselves to be more productive.
              They help us make decisions, creating focus around the problem we
              are trying to solve. They improve our consistency, which provides
              a better experience for our users. And they help us grow, a
              valuable asset in times of innovation.

            <h5>Leveling up with Flexbot</h5>

            <p>By now, you’ve probably heard of “flexbox,” short for the CSS
               Flexible Box Layout module and the most fully developed and well
               supported of CSS3’s wide array of new layout mechanisms. Flexbox
               allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without having to
               worry about all those pesky float layout quirks we’ve dealt with
               for over a decade. But with cross-browser support still
               incomplete, you’ve probably relegated flexbox to the “one day”
               pile of web design tricks.

               It’s time to stop waiting. In this talk, Zoe aims to convince you
               that it’s a good idea to start learning and using flexbox today.
               You’ll learn how to take your designs—and web design skills—to
               the next level as we use flexbox as practical progressive
               enhancement, adding it in bits and pieces on individual page
               components with graceful fallbacks.
